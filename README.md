A submission for the [2023 Unihacks Competition](https://unihacks-2023.devpost.com/), HealthCheck is a free and open source EHR (Electronic Health Record), which doctors and practitioners can use to store patient notes.


## Why did we make this?
We created HealthCheck with one goal in mind: To make patient data more accessible. 
We believe that every doctor should be able to access their patient's medical data quickly and easily,
especially during emergencies. The minutes spent flipping through a file cabinet could be the very time that makes the
difference between life and death.

## What does it offer?            
We offer a minimalistic, yet multi-functional platform that will make it easy for doctors to streamline their tasks
without overwhelming them with unnecessary features. Its easy-to-use nature allows new doctors to quickly adapt to the
platform, while its advanced capabilities cater to the needs of experienced healthcare professionals, making it a
versatile tool for all levels of medical expertise.

## Is it secure?
We understand that data security is a top concern for healthcare provides around the world. That's why we have
implemented state-of-the-art security measures to ensure that all patient data is protected and remains confidential.


## What's the goal?            
Our goal at HealthCheck is to improve the quality of care and streamline the healthcare system by making patient data
more accessible to medical professionals. We believe that by providing doctors with the necessary tools to store and
study patient medical information, we can help create a more patient-centric and efficient healthcare system.

## How can I run it?
Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/WFeng7/Unihacks-2023.git`, and install the required packages by entering the directory and running `npm i`.

You'll also need to setup a http server, something which there are many different guides on how to do.

## How can I develop it?
To develop, you'll need a [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) compiler, as well as the backend server.

The backend server can be found [here](https://github.com/WFeng7/Unihacks-Backend), which requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).
